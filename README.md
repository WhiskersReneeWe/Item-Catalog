# Item Catalog - A Udacity project 
## This is my second Full Stack learning experience using Flask ([First Experience here](https://github.com/WhiskersReneeWe/keras_image_classifer))

# Introduction

This is a Flask Web Application for displaying items for a sports store! This is a very basic web app where a user can add, edit, or delete an item of his/her chosen category. This web app allows a user to sign in and out but only using Google accounts. I use OAuth to authenticate users to grant them the capabilities to add, edit, and delete items they created.

# Usage
## Note, it is recommended to set up an Anaconda environment to get this app start running


0. Download all files in this repository to your local computer and store them in one directory.
1. Fire up an Anaconda Prompt, use the following command to create a virtual environment.
    * cd `your local directory` (change the working directory)
    * conda create -n itemcatalog_project --file itemcatalog_env.yml (For example, I name this project as itemcatalog_project)


2. run the following commands,
   * `python app.py` 
   
3. When it is up and running, go to http://127.0.0.1:5000
4. The display should be like this,
