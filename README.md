# Item Catalog - A Udacity project 
## This is my second Full Stack learning experience using Flask ([First Experience here](https://github.com/WhiskersReneeWe/keras_image_classifer))

# Introduction

This is a Flask Web Application for displaying items for a sports store! This is a very basic web app where a user can add, edit, or delete an item of his/her chosen category. This web app allows a user to sign in and out but only using Google accounts. 

# Usage
## Note, it is recommended to set up an Anaconda environment to get this app start running

1. Fire up an Anaconda Prompt, use the following command to create a virtual environment.
    * (For example, I name this project as itemcatalog_project) conda create -n itemcatalog_project --file itemcatalog_env.yml

2. Download all files to your local computer and store them in one directory.
3. run the following commands,
   * `python app.py` 
   
4. When it is up and running, go to http://127.0.0.1:5000
5. The display should be like this,
